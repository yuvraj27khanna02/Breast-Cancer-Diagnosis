# Breast Cancer Diagnosis

## Libraries
scikit-learn, tensorflow, pandas

## Description
Neural Network Model used to predict breast cancer.  Use scikit-learn and tensorflow to train an AI Model based on real Breast Cancer data.  The program returns the accuracy of the model.  the activation function used is Sigmoid.  model uses optimization function adam and focuses on improving accuracy of predicting Breast Cancer. 

## How to run program
run aiModel.py file.  the number of Neurons per Neuron Network layer can be adjusted using NEURON_NUMBER on line 5.  the number of epochs can be adjusted using EPOCH_NUMBER on line 6.
